## Installation

Getting started with EpicScan is simple! Choose your preferred package manager, npm or yarn, to install the SDK:

```bash
# Install via npm
npm install @epicchain/epicscan-sdk-ts

# Or install via yarn
yarn add @epicchain/epicscan-sdk-ts
```

Once installed, you can start integrating the SDK into your project and building blockchain-powered applications that take full advantage of the EpicChain ecosystem.

## Quickstart

### Initial Setup

Follow these steps to set up EpicScan quickly:

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Build the SDK:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

4. **Configure your project**: Make sure to set up your configuration files to connect to the EpicChain blockchain API securely.

5. **Start using EpicScan in your app**: Begin making API calls to fetch blockchain data, aggregate it, and create analytics tools that will power your application.

### General Usage

EpicScan simplifies common blockchain operations, allowing developers to focus on building their products. For workflow examples and SDK usage, check out the [tests](./src/tests) directory. Here, you will find working examples for:

- Fetching real-time blockchain data.
- Aggregating and filtering blockchain data.
- Creating custom data analytics workflows.
- Using API methods to enhance your blockchain-powered apps.

For example, you can use the SDK to retrieve transaction details, explore network metrics, and monitor wallet activity.

## Examples

Here’s a basic usage example of the EpicScan SDK in a TypeScript project:

```typescript
import { EpicScanClient } from '@epicchain/epicscan-sdk-ts';

// Initialize the client with your API key and base URL
const client = new EpicScanClient({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key-here',
  baseUrl: 'https://api.epic-chain.org',
});

// Fetch the latest block data
async function fetchBlockData() {
  try {
    const latestBlock = await client.getLatestBlock();
    console.log('Latest Block:', latestBlock);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching block data:', error);
  }
}

fetchBlockData();
```

In this example, the `EpicScanClient` is initialized with your API key and a base URL. The `getLatestBlock()` method is called to retrieve the latest block from the EpicChain blockchain, which can then be logged to the console or processed further in your application.

## API Documentation

For in-depth details on how to use the SDK, refer to the [API Reference](https://epic-chain.org/docs/epicscan-sdk). Here you’ll find:

- Detailed descriptions of all available methods and their parameters.
- Example API calls for common use cases.
- Authentication and configuration guides.
- Instructions for error handling and debugging.

The API is designed to be intuitive and flexible, with type definitions that help you work seamlessly within the TypeScript ecosystem.
